# demo-react-flask-mui-auth

Example React app utilizing MaterialUI with Flask JWT-authed API backend using flask-restful and flask-jwt-extended.

I am by no means an expert in these technologies - in learning, I found there was many different implementation techniques for both Flask and React when considering how to protect resources - I wanted to demonstrate one methodology I found particularly easy to implement while also providing a decent authentication mechanism for users.  Keep in mind I am not paying any mind to 'authorization' in this demo and am considering all users to have the same level of permissions in both the front-end and back-end implementations.
